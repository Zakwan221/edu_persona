                <h2>Red Personality - Passionate & Bold</h2>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">Overview</h3>
                <p>The Red personality type is characterized by strength, determination, and leadership. Reds are natural-born leaders with a drive for power and achievement. They are decisive, proactive, and willful, always ready to take action and overcome challenges. They approach life with confidence and assertiveness, often becoming the catalysts for change in their environments.</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-title">Core Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Reds are motivated by power, competition, and the need to win. They have a strong desire to be in control and to influence others. Their approach to life is direct, forthright, and sometimes forceful. Reds tend to be goal-oriented, focusing on the end result rather than the process. They value efficiency, results, and recognition for their achievements.</p>
                <p>The inner world of a Red personality is characterized by a constant drive for improvement and achievement. They often set high standards for themselves and others, and are internally motivated by challenges that test their abilities and determination. Reds typically have a clear vision of what they want and the confidence to pursue it with unwavering focus.</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-title">Behavior & Mindset</h3>
                <p>Reds thrive on challenges and competition. They are highly ambitious and always aim to be the best in whatever they pursue. Their strong personality means they rarely back down from confrontation and will often stand their ground firmly in disputes. This confidence can sometimes come across as arrogance or stubbornness.</p>
                <p>In decision making, Reds sometimes act before thinking things through completely, which can lead to conflicts with others. They're natural risk-takers who aren't afraid to venture into unknown territory if they believe it will lead to success or advancement. This bold approach to life makes them excellent pioneers and entrepreneurs.</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-title">Communication Style</h3>
                <p>Reds communicate in a straightforward, no-nonsense manner. They are direct, assertive, and sometimes blunt. They value clarity and brevity, preferring to get to the point quickly without unnecessary elaboration. Reds often speak with confidence and authority, using commanding language and decisive tones. Their communication is action-oriented, often focused on what needs to be done and how to accomplish goals.</p>
                <p>In conversations, Reds may dominate discussions and can be impatient with tangents or what they perceive as inefficient communication. They appreciate others who can match their directness and provide clear, concise information. When giving feedback, Reds tend to be candid and unfiltered, valuing honesty over tact.</p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Core Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Blacks are motivated by autonomy, understanding, and the desire for authenticity. They have a strong need for independence and self-determination. Their approach to life is introspective, questioning, and often skeptical of mainstream opinions or values.

                <p>The inner world of a Black personality is rich with analysis, contemplation, and a continual pursuit of deeper truths. They typically develop a strong internal framework of principles and beliefs, against which they measure new information and experiences.

                <p>In social settings, Blacks often take on the role of observer rather than active participant. They prefer to watch and analyze social dynamics before engaging, giving them insights that more outgoing personalities might miss.

                <p>When Blacks do engage in conversation, they prefer deep intellectual discussions over small talk. They enjoy exploring complex topics, philosophical questions, and meaningful exchanges that challenge their thinking. Surface-level interactions often feel draining or pointless to them.</p>

They invest significant thought and care into their close connections, even if they maintain a smaller social circle than other personality types.</p>
                <p>Many Blacks appreciate dark humor, philosophy, and mystery stories that explore the depths of human experience or challenge conventional thinking. Their entertainment preferences often reflect their comfort with complexity and their interest in themes others might find too heavy or intense.</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-title">Communication Style</h3>
                <p>Blacks communicate in a thoughtful, direct manner that prioritizes honesty over social niceties. They value substantive content over small talk and may seem reserved or aloof in social situations that feel superficial. Blacks tend to be selective about sharing their thoughts and feelings, opening up more fully with the few people they deeply trust.</p>
                <p>In discussions, Blacks often ask penetrating questions that cut to the heart of matters. They are willing to challenge assumptions and explore taboo or controversial topics if they believe it serves the pursuit of truth. Blacks typically prefer one-on-one conversations to group discussions and may withdraw if conversations become too superficial or conformist. They communicate most freely when they feel their independence and authenticity are respected.</p>
